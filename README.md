# Insight
Insight data science coding challenge

I submitted as is to meet the deadline of the 24th. The error at the end for me was not being able to reset the index to order the running average column correctly with the existing dataframe. I tried multiple variations of .reset_index() without success.

Thanks for the opportunity!
